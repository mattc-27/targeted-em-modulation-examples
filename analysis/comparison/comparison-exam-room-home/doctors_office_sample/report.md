Environment: Public waiting area
Expected Influence: Minimal external interference
Key Observations:

    Amplitude Envelope: Smooth, flat, with only one spike

    Cepstrum: Rapid decay, low quefrency activity

    Chromagram: Dominant B pitch; no tonal cycling

    Modulation Spectrum: DC-heavy; no peaks in delta/theta range

    Phase Inversion: Clean cancellation

    Spectral Peaks: Tight cluster; low inharmonicity

    Spectrogram: Static frequency bands, no vertical transients

✅ Conclusion: Clean baseline recording — likely free from modulation or interference.

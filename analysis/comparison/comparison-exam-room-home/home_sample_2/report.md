Environment: At home
Expected Influence: Strong suspected interference or synthetic entrainment
Key Observations:

    Amplitude Envelope: Strong pulses at beginning and end, ripple-like midsection

    Cepstrum: Higher sustained low-mid quefrency energy

    Chromagram: Heavy and consistent G-tone dominance throughout

    Modulation Spectrum: Strongest delta modulation observed so far (~0.5â€“3 Hz)

    Phase Inversion: Breaks in cancellation pattern, especially during bursts

    Spectral Peaks: High inharmonicity and dissonance

    Spectrogram: Dense vertical streaks + upper harmonic activity (8kHzâ€“16kHz)

ðŸš¨ Conclusion: High-confidence signal of potential external modulation with entrainment characteristics.

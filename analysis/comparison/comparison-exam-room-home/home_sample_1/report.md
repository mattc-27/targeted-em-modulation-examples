Environment: At home
Expected Influence: Potential moderate synthetic signal activity
Key Observations:

    Amplitude Envelope: Fluctuations with spikes mid-to-late recording

    Cepstrum: Slight energy in mid-quefrency range

    Chromagram: G/B/F tonal dominance repeating over time

    Modulation Spectrum: Peaks in delta range (1–2 Hz)

    Phase Inversion: Slight residuals suggest partial asymmetry

    Spectral Peaks: Multiple clusters, moderate inharmonicity

    Spectrogram: Mild vertical banding and harmonic trails

⚠️ Conclusion: Medium-strength indicators of low-frequency modulation and tonal entrainment.

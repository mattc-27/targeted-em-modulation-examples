# Investigate irregular patterns in ambient recordings using spectral, modulation, and inharmonicity-based methods.

This repository contains audio samples and signal analyses exploring potential psychoacoustic anomalies. The goal is to document and investigate irregular patterns in ambient recordings using spectral, modulation, and inharmonicity-based methods.

## Contents
- `data/`: Raw and processed audio files
- `analysis/`: Scripts and plots for signal analysis
- `docs/`: Method summaries and example findings

## Status
Ongoing investigation. Intended for open research and documentation.

ðŸ§¾ Summary

This repository documents signal analysis from three audio recordings using:

    Amplitude modulation envelope mapping

    Cepstral energy tracking

    Tonal salience (chromagram)

    Sub-50 Hz modulation spectrum

    Phase inversion test

    Peak dissonance metrics

    Spectrogram (log-frequency)

Clear escalation of signal artifacts is observed from the baseline (doctorâ€™s office) to the second home clip. These align with features associated with synthetic modulation, including:

    Rhythmic entrainment (1â€“3 Hz)

    Tonal reinforcement (G/B)

    Inharmonic bursts

    Possible ultrasonic energy above 15kHz
